            “It takes a village to raise a child”. A single person’s story is intertwined and built from individual pieces of culture, people and stories coming together just as a village comes together to raise a child. Reflected in the memories of our childhood we see emotive interpretations of the villages that raised us. Now our smallest units are found within ourselves.

            The environments around us are filled with stories. Our worlds and spaces built from smaller pieces of narratives & culture rooted in our memories. Abstract forms are charged with meaning alongside the utilitarian purposes they were created with.
            <br><br>
            Within our worlds are sprawling events and histories that come together and find home within the personal background of an individual. As the world becomes more global the networks of connections become more complex and wide spread. The idea of hyperlocality is no longer bound to a singular space or time, rather it exists within the many connections we hold with one another and the means in which we function within these connections.
            <br><br>
            The Smallest Unit is a delineated publishing space for those that live within the diasporic cultures and living within the fringes to explore, build upon and finally publish their network of world and histories to the exterior world. It asks for people to provide cultural personal perspectives on the “smallest” unit of their practices/livelihoods.
