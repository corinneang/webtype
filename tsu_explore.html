                Like the worlds around us letterforms are wrapped in layers of meaning. They act as one of our primary means of communication. However, this is not only done through the words that these letters make, but also their forms. Each letterform holds its own story and roots. Worlds and narratives push on the abstract structure of the letter to create its form. Alone letters can stand as cultural artifacts and vehicles for expression.

            <div class="stacking corinne">Within the Philippines, vernacular hand painted signs are a means of expression and have become a strong marker of the modern Filipino aesthetic. However, it is important to note that the latin language system was imposed as a means of enforcing power during the Spanish colonial rule. The jeepney that are adorned with these vernacular letterforms were introduced by the American army during their period of colonization. Beneath these letterforms that are deemed symbolic of the Filipino visual language lay systems and structures forced upon the Filipino people in moments when their voices were deemed as less valid. Despite this, the Filipino people have taken these structures of oppression and transformed them through their personal values, experiences and emotions into a vibrant vehicle of self expression.</div>
